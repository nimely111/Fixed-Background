# Comparison with the Greater Than Operator The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing. Examples
# 5   >  3  // true
# 7   > '3' // true
# 2   >  3  // false
# '1' >  9  // false
# Introducing Else Statements
# When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is # executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. # With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

# if (num > 10) {
#   return "Bigger than 10";
# } else {
#   return "10 or Less";
# }
# }Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement.
